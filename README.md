# James Tripp CV

This repository contains the files for building my CV. I forked and then modified the [diogcamacho/CV](https://github.com/diogocamacho/CV) repository.

The CV uses the rather excellent vitae package from R. To build the CV clone this repository, install R and the required packages (detailed in the .rmd file) and then build the .rmd file. The result is a nice looking JT.pdf file in this repo.
